		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>My name is Michael Majdalani and I am currently a Senior in Computer Engineering at the University of Rhode Island. 
			As an Engineering major, I have been taught the skill of lifelong learning, as well as many other engineering 
			skills. I have completed several projects over the past four years, but my interest is mainly in 
			hardware development, firmware, and some web development. My experiences at the University of Rhode Island 
			have prepared me to tackle any problem that appears in the workforce.</p>

	  <p>I am very interested in mechanical design and the interaction between mechanical components and electrical or simple computer systems (such as a microcontroller). I am also interested in startup companies. </p>
		<p>The projects shown on this website fall into one of three categories: <a href="businessprojects.html">Business Projects</a>, <a href="bsmeprojects.html">BSME Projects</a>, and <a href="recentprojects.html">Recent Projects</a>. The Business Projects section shows mainly business plan competitions and startup companies I have worked with. BSME Projects shows many of the projects I worked on during my time at UW that were in mechanical engineering classes. The Recent Projects section shows engineering related projects I have worked on since graduating. The image below shows a photorealistic render of an <a href="chargeforiphone.html">iPhone case</a> I designed that has a built in power supply to charge the phone.</p>
